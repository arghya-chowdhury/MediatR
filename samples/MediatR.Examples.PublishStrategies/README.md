Publishing Strategy
=======

### Adding additional strategy

It's just a 3 step process.

1. Implement IPublishStrategy to your new strategy class. You'll get all startegies in "Strategy" folder.
2. Add a new StartegyMap which is nothing but a glue between Enumeration and the startegy.
3. Use your own strategy into handler.
